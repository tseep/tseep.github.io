After the financial crisis many macro-prudential authorities in European Union have introduced regulations on mortgage lending in order to mitigate and prevent excessive credit growth and leverage. One of the most popular policies has been a loan-to-value limit on mortgage lending. In addition to choosing different levels for the loan-to-value limit, macro-prudential authorities have also taken diverse approaches to timing (immediate or pre-announced) and the shape of the transition path (sharp or gradual). I construct a small open economy model with heterogeneous agents, incomplete markets, long-term mortgage, and default to analyse different paths for introducing loan-to-value policies.","tags":null,"title":"Introducing loan-to-value limit on mortgage loans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanno Kase","Matthias Rottner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607947230,"objectID":"9bad60b071083334d7b062ed14fa1fc1","permalink":"https://www.hannokase.com/publication/work-in-progress/deep-learning-zlb/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/work-in-progress/deep-learning-zlb/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we analyze the potential of machine learning techniques to solve nonlinear macroeconomic models with an occasionally binding zero lower bound on the interest rate. Our solution method uses neural networks to approximate the policy functions. We show that neural networks can capture the nonlinear dynamics that arise from the zero lower bound such as precautionary savings and the deflationary bias. Comparing a neural network approach with standard global solution techniques, we find that the solution to a canonical New Keynesian model with a zero lower bound coincide for both methods. A distinctive feature of the neural network method is that it can solve large models. As a consequence, machine learning is well suited to solve medium-scale New Keynesian models with the zero lower bound that features a variety of exogenous shocks in its nonlinear specification.","tags":null,"title":"Solving New Keynesian Models with Machine Learning: A Neural Network Approach","type":"publication"}]
