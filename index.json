After the financial crisis many macro-prudential authorities in European Union have introduced regulations on mortgage lending in order to mitigate and prevent excessive credit growth and leverage. One of the most popular policies has been a loan-to-value limit on mortgage lending. In addition to choosing different levels for the loan-to-value limit, macro-prudential authorities have also taken diverse approaches to timing (immediate or pre-announced) and the shape of the transition path (sharp or gradual). I construct a small open economy model with heterogeneous agents, incomplete markets, long-term mortgage, and default to analyse different paths for introducing loan-to-value policies.","tags":null,"title":"Introducing loan-to-value limit on mortgage loans","type":"publication"}]
